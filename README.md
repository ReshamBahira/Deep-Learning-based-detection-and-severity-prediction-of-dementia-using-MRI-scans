# Deep Learning-based Detection and Severity Prediction of Dementia using MRI Scans

## Project Overview
Dementia affects millions worldwide, with cases projected to rise significantly. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention. Traditional approaches often lack the ability to provide interpretable results or highlight the specific brain regions affected. This study overcomes these limitations by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to classify dementia severity and provide visual explanations for predictions.

### Goals
- Employ Deep Learning techniques to detect and predict the severity of dementia using MRI scans.
- Classify dementia into four severity levels:
  - **Class 0**: No Dementia
  - **Class 1**: Very Mild Demented
  - **Class 2**: Mild Demented
  - **Class 3**: Moderately Demented
- Provide region-specific analysis by identifying key brain regions influencing predictions.
- Enhance interpretability and confidence in model predictions.

## Importance of Grad-CAM in Medical Diagnosis
Medical imaging technologies like MRI provide critical diagnostic insights. While deep learning models demonstrate exceptional performance in analyzing such data, their "black-box" nature limits adoption in clinical settings. Grad-CAM addresses this challenge by generating heatmaps that explain classification results, highlighting the contribution of specific brain regions. This improves trust and understanding among medical professionals.

| DenseNet      | 0.55      | 0.55   | 0.55     | 0.55     |
| InceptionV3   | 0.57      | 0.57   | 0.56     | 0.57     |
| EfficientNet  | 0.15      | 0.28   | 0.16     | 0.28     |

### Observations
- **Best Model**: CNN achieved the highest accuracy (87%) with minimal overfitting.
- **Confusion Matrix**: CNN classified the "Very Mild Demented" class most accurately.

### Grad-CAM Results
- Grad-CAM heatmaps provide transparency by visualizing brain regions influencing dementia severity predictions.
  - Example:
    - **Very Mild Demented Image**: Blue areas highlight influential regions.
    - **Non-Demented Image**: Red areas indicate minimal influence.
